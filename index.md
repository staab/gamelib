# What is this?

GameLib is a small, local business focused on letting people in and around Moscow try out new board and card games, without closing their savings account.

# How does it work?

It works like this â€” we maintain a library of great board games, and for a membership fee of $5 a month, you get access to them. We'll use this money to buy new games, which members get to vote on.

For those of you who have more games than cash, you can lend us your games for $1 off your membership fee for every month you games are in circulation. That means that if you let us circulate 5 games, you get to participate for free!

# How do I join?

For now, we're handling everything by email. You can reach me at <a href="mailto:shtaab@gmail.com">shtaab@gmail.com</a>, and you can view our catalog of games <a href="/catalog">here</a>.
